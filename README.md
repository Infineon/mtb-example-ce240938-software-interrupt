## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.


The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ce240938-software-interrupt](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce240938-software-interrupt)" application with the desired name "SoftwareInterrupt" configured for the *KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE --app-id mtb-example-ce240938-software-interrupt --user-app-name SoftwareInterrupt --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>

      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the following message is displayed on the UART terminal.

## Design and implementation

This design consists of one TCPWM counter and one user LED. Interrupts can be generated by using software to set an interrupt flag in the timer resource. For this purpose, the timer is configured to allow software to set an interrupt request from the terminal. This interrupt is processed by an interrupt handler, which will toggle the user LED2.

**STDIN/STDOUT setting**

- Initialization of the GPIO for UART is done in the [cy_retarget_io_init()](https://infineon.github.io/retarget-io/html/group__group__board__libs.html#ga4905a76eaea9b40111887f5b6ff7d252) function
- Initialize the pin specified by CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_TX as UART TX, the pin specified by CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_RX as UART RX (these pins are connected to KitProg3 COM port)
- The serial port parameters are set to 8N1 and 115200 baud

The [Cy_SCB_UART_Get()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__scb__uart__low__level__functions.html#ga86ab3686a98a0e215c1f2eeed3ce254f) function returns the user input from the terminal as received data.

**GPIO port pin initialization**

- Initialization of the GPIO port pin is done after the [Cy_GPIO_Pin_Init()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__gpio__functions__init.html#gad61553f65d4e6bd827eb6464a7913461) function.
- Initialize the pin specified by *CYBSP_USER_LED2* as output (initial level = H, LED turns off)

**TCPWM initialization**

API calls for the TCPWM initialization is done in *init_Timer_Interrupt()* function.
- To initialize the TCPWM counter, [Cy_TCPWM_Counter_Init()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__counter.html#ga6068a06ddc8a07c67bb6df86e920944c) function is called using the [cy_stc_tcpwm_counter_config_t](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/structcy__stc__tcpwm__counter__config__t.html) structure. This is auto-coded by the Device Configurator using the following parameters.

   **Figure 2. Counter settings**
    
   <img src="./images/counter_set.png" width="800"/>

- The counter is enabled by the [Cy_TCPWM_SetInterruptMask()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__counter.html#ga1707e2cc291fe486fbea346157c65bff) function and the terminal count interrupt is enabled by setting the [Cy_TCPWM_Counter_Enable()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#ga47ec0d6214c01f67774fb97b9c3f0878) function using the mask value of *CY_TCPWM_INT_ON_TC*
- Next, the interrupt handler is registered by using the [Cy_SysInt_Init()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__sysint__functions.html#gab2ff6820a898e9af3f780000054eea5d) function and is enabled via the *NVIC_EnableIRQ()* function

**Interrupt detection**

- If 'p' is pressed, the [Cy_TCPWM_SetInterrupt()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#ga567d7ae9e63aed64f0c73e45183a4674) function is used to set the interrupt flag of the configured counter. This will cause a peripheral interrupt in the CPU which will then be handled by the registered *handle_Counter_Interrupt_0()* function. The handler function clears the interrupt flag by using the [Cy_TCPWM_ClearInterrupt()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#ga0c7a2d667dc983c82327463529f5d283) function in the counter and toggles the state of the user LED2 by calling the [Cy_GPIO_Inv()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__gpio__functions__gpio.html#ga449eb0f5c040b99aec41b81da2e9c71f) function.
